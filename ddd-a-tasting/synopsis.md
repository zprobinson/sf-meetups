# Domain Driven Design: A Tasting

Domain driven design has become a popular design approach initially coined by Eric Evans in 2003.
It has spread through the application development community like wildfire. Come join us for a small tasting of
this powerful methodology, where we will explore the key concepts and principles of domain driven design.
We will discuss how to identify and model domain entities, aggregate roots, value objects, and domain services.
We will also delve into the concept of bounded contexts and how they help in managing complex domains.
Whether you are new to domain driven design or have some experience, this meetup talk will provide an opportunity
to enhance your software development skills.

Zach Robinson from Interstates will talk about his experiences learning domain driven design
and implementing it in a few projects. Some successes, some failures, but hopefully a good learning opportunity for everyone.
